Mac Grapher Math Models for various projects

Open .gcx files with Grapher on your Mac.

#FYI
I'm not a mathematician, I'm just an engineer with mediocre math skills at best. Most of these models are not intended to be true to reality but rather an adaptation for gaming so please judge accordingly.

Apologies to Windows users, I don't know of an equivalent tool for Windows and I really love Mac Grapher :)

My models are typically broken out for the sake of easy translation to code.  I typically use these for game development which ends up as C if I'm doing SDL/OpenGL or C# if I'm using Unity.  The theme you will hopefully find is math functions with abstracted parameters for the sake of readability and simple functions as you might find them in code.  I try to scope my function variables with prefix "p" for param and group variables with an "m" for member to help namespace the variables to reduce collisions -- Grapher isn't very good at that.

Gravity for games.

I tried to break it up easily for translation to code.
